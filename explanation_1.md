In this program, a dictionary 'cache' is used to store (key,value) mapping, and 'val' and 'num' are used to track the access history. This program has been tested for 3 test cases. Here 'n' is the input size (size of the cache). 

Time complexity - O(1)
Here, the get and set operations are performed in O(1) time.

Space complexity - O(n)
As we are storing values twice here, we have space complexity as O(2n) which is essentially O(n).
